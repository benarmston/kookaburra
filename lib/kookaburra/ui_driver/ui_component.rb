    # UIComponent is intended to be subclassed to represent each component of
    # your application-under-test's user interface. The purpose of the
    # UIComponent object is to abstract away the implementation details of your
    # interface when testing and allow you to concentrate on testing your
    # business requirements. For instance, a UIComponent subclass for your
    # sign-up form might have accessors for the individual fields as well as
    # methods that allow you to perform distinct operations:
    #
    # @example SignUpForm component
    #   class SignUpForm < Kookaburra::UIDriver::UIComponent
    #     def component_path
    #       '/signup'
    #     end
    #
    #     def component_locator
    #       '#sign_up_form'
    #     end
    #
    #     def email
    #       find('#user_email').value
    #     end
    #
    #     def email=(new_email)
    #       fill_in 'user_email', :with => new_email
    #     end
    #
    #     def password
    #       find('#user_password').value
    #     end
    #
    #     def password=(new_password)
    #       fill_in 'user_password', :with => new_password
    #     end
    #
    #     def password_confirmation
    #       find('#user_password_confirmation').value
    #     end
    #
    #     def password_confirmation=(new_password_confirmation)
    #       fill_in 'user_password_confirmation', :with => new_password_confirmation
    #     end
    #
    #     def submit
    #       click_button 'Sign Up'
    #     end
    #
    #     def sign_up(data = {})
    #       self.email = data[:email]
    #       self.password = data[:password]
    #       self.password_confirmation = data[:password_confirmation]
    #       submit
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # Note that the "browser operation" methods such as `#fill_in` and
    # `#click_button` are delegated to a {ScopedBrowser} and are
    # automatically scoped to the component's DOM element.    
    #
    # @note Even though a `UIComponent` should respond to all of the
    #   methods on the browser (i.e. all of the Capybara DSL methods),
    #   for some reason call to `#select` get routed to `Kernel#select`.
    #   You can get around this by calling it as `self.select`. See
    #   https://gist.github.com/3192103 for an example of this behavior.
